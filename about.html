         The ROHO Foundation Kenya was founded in 2020 by a group of Kenyan youth, with an aim to reach out to the less fortunate in the society and helpout where we can.
        We are a non-profit and non-gorvernment organisation that is dedicated to make a positive change in the society.
        At ROHO, we believe that progress and change can be made when we come together to help those in need in our communities.</em></h1>

            <h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>
            <p>We seek to identify different groups of people that are in need in our society and offer them the help that we can. During school breaks, most of the children's home
            may not be able to maintain the daily provision of basic needs and that is where we step in. Twice or thrice in a month we save up some funds from various generous people
            and buy food to distribute to the children's home. We also gather some clothes to take to them. We try as mush as we can to provide them with clean healthy food and clothing. </p>

            <h2>FUTURE PLANS</h2>
            <p>Soon, we would like to expand our organization from being based in Nairobi only to other parts of the country. Our main goal is to become a global organization that helps our the needy.
            With the help of volunteers we want to make the world a better place by giving hope to the ones in need. Also, we would offer mentorship services and also councelling to those in need of it.
